started on the 14th

design
    - clicking gallery piece is weird on mobile chrome (iphone is fine)
    - check its all fine when the window is not full height
    - check its all fine when the window is massive
    - animate the landing tile with a canvas or rebass-like animation

OUT OF SCOPE?
talk about extra curricular things?
highlight the navigation button when tile is visible
mobile - when clicking the draw on the navigation, the tabs should open smoothly
animations of text
safari smooth scroll doesn't work

WHEN MAPS ARE DONE
    - update the picture on porfolio website
    - Ensure link to the mapping tool works on porfolio website
    - Mapping tool is a boring name
